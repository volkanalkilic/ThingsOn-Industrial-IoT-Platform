Introduction
This is an industrial IoT platform that is compliant with the Reactive Manifesto. The platform is designed to handle the complex, dynamic and real-time requirements of industrial operations, while also providing powerful data analytics capabilities for advanced industrial IoT applications.

Please note that the licensing model for this platform has not yet been decided, but it will be free to use. Also, please note that the platform is under active development, so there may be bugs or missing features.

Key Features
Resilience and fault tolerance: Platform is designed to handle and recover from failures, ensuring that industrial operations continue without interruption.
Scalability and Elasticity: Platform is designed to automatically scale up or down based on the workload by adding or removing resources dynamically.
Real-time response: Platform provides low latency and fast response times, which are essential for real-time industrial operations such as manufacturing and logistics.
Data analytics: Platform provide powerful data analytics capabilities to process and extract insights from large amounts of data.
Security: Platform is designed to keep data, devices and communications secure from unauthorized access and breaches.
Flexibility and interoperability: Platform is built on open source technology and microservices architecture, making it easy to integrate with existing industrial systems and protocols.
Flexibility and High availability: Platform is built for high availability, meaning it can accommodate a large number of connected devices without fail and provide a fault-tolerant design.
Low Latency: Platform is designed to have low end-to-end latency which is critical to meet the real-time requirements of industrial process.
Robustness: Platform is designed to handle harsh conditions that might be present in industrial environments, such as dust, vibration and extreme temperatures.
